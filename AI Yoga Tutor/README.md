This project introduces a revolutionary real-time yoga pose detection and correction
system, leveraging artificial intelligence and computer vision technologies. The systemâ€™s
core functionality lies in its ability to accurately identify and classify diverse yoga poses
through analysis of live webcam footage. Unlike traditional methods, our system provides
immediate, personalized audio feedback to guide practitioners toward optimal alignment
and form during their yoga practice. The user interface is designed for seamless integration, ensuring a positive and engaging experience. The proposed system addresses
the limitations of existing manual approaches by offering scalable, technologically-driven
feedback, thereby enhancing the overall quality and effectiveness of yoga sessions. This
project not only contributes to the advancement of AI applications in health and wellness
but also represents a transformative step towards redefining the intersection of technology
and mindful physical activities.
